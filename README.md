# Coursera-Algorithms-for-DNA-Sequencing
We will learn computational methods -- algorithms and data structures -- for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We will learn a little about DNA, genomics, and how DNA sequencing is used.  We will use Python to implement key algorithms and data structures and to analyze real genomes and DNA sequencing datasets.

Week1 DNA sequencing, strings and matching
This module we begin our exploration of algorithms for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We'll discuss DNA sequencing technology, its past and present, and how it works.

Week2 Preprocessing, indexing and approximate matching
In this module, we learn useful and flexible new algorithms for solving the exact and approximate matching problems. We'll start by learning Boyer-Moore, a fast and very widely used algorithm for exact matching

Week3 Edit distance, assembly, overlaps
This week we finish our discussion of read alignment by learning about algorithms that solve both the edit distance problem and related biosequence analysis problems, like global and local alignment.

Week4 Algorithms for assembly
In the last module we began our discussion of the assembly problem and we saw a couple basic principles behind it. In this module, we'll learn a few ways to solve the alignment problem.
